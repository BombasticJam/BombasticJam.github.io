<h2>A small essay</h1>

   <h1>Absoluatae Monarchs</h1>
<p>There are many examples of absolute monarchs Catherine the Great of Russia, Peter the Great, and King Louis XIV of France. Catherine the Great wanted to provide Enlightenment and disagreed against serfdom. However, Catherine the Great wanted to end it but she needed the rich, landowning nobles to help her run Russia. Even though she was an absolute monarch because she wanted power, she still tried to find a way to not use serfdom but it was avoidable for her terms of having all the power. Peter the Great became an absolute monarchy and helped Russia grow as a nation. He believed in enlightenment and helped reform Russia from society to military. And he also helped reform the government and divide it into different provinces. King Louis XIV was a hard-working and meticulous ruler who oversaw his programs down to the last detail, Louis XIV nevertheless appreciated art, literature, music, theater and sports. To accommodate his retinue of newly devoted nobles (and, perhaps, to distance himself from the population of Paris), Louis built several lavish manor houses that depleted the nation’s coffers while drawing accusations of extravagance.
This article has changed what we knew about absolute monarchs overall. Before reading this, I had the mindset that absolute monarchs wanted only power for their own good; not for their country. However, while reading this article, I soon found that not all absolute monarchs thought that way. Some monarchs such as Catherine the Great of Russia wanted absolute monarchy so that she can help make Russia better and thrive. Even though she had to use serfdom, she did that only to keep Russia running otherwise Russia would’ve fallen due to loss in money and production. This also added more information into my knowledge on this topic. Absolute monarchs can be both positive or negative for the society and well being. 
Some other things we have learned while reading this was how enlightenment became to be throughout Europe. Enlightenment was based on ideas of liberty and science. The rulers who used Enlightenment used it as a good thing for their county. These rulers tried to change their countries for the better. However, some of these rulers used enlightenment to make themselves look good. These rulers wanted to have absolute power. They were able to make people’s lives better by using that kind of power. This way of ruling was called “Enlightenment Absolutism”. The Enlightenment had helped the absolute monarchs. But it had also taught everyone else to think for themselves.
Therefore, this article did help change our mindset on the topic being of absolute monarchs. Not all absolute monarchs wanted power for their own but to help their country grow stronger. And even if necessary, they’ll risk their positions in order to spread enlightenment or reform governements.
