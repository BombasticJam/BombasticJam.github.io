<h1>The story of Max</h1>
<p> Max is a fluffy shibe who likes to take walks and eats a lot. He likes to bite everything he can get his mouth onto and tries to get people's attention. He does this so people can play with him, otherwise he'll get sad. When he gets sad, he gets depressed and starts to bite and do bad things that are considered as "Bad Manners". Max is always stubborn and needs food to do orders. And when he completes those orders, he goes back to sleep or eats even more. That's the story of Max. Eat, sleep, repeat...</p>
